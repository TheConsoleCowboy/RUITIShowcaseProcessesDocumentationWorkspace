        <h1>17 February 2023</h1>
        <p>Following about a week of preparation for the career fair 
            (including resume preparation, both independently and at the 
            drop-in clinic), I attended the fair itself. I will be 
            completely transparent in admitting the fair to be a bit 
            overwhelming, likely for two reasons: (1) being that my 
            ambitions are not necessarily towards industry, I was 
            considerably underprepared in terms of what I was looking to 
            get out of the fair which (2) only really served to fuel my 
            social anxiety when I would approach a table and the 
            representative wsas very clearly not looking for anything 
            other than a candidate they could hire. Perhaps I went into 
            it looking for a network event but instead found a peacocking 
            session.</p>
        
        <p>However, attendance taught me some valuable lessons and 
            have some ideas for how I will reapproach this assignment 
            once I identify another career fair, as I would like to, 
            which I will explain more in another document. Rather than 
            write up the raw, scatterbrained notes containing those ideas,
            I will instead write them up as two reports:</p>
