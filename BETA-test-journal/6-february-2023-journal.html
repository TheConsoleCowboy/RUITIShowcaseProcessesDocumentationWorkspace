      <p>Knowing very little about what was meant by "Big Interview," I ran a Google search on the term. Halfway through my
        search, I noticed the autofill tag "Rutgers" onto the end. So I ran that search. One of the top links that came up 
        was [Prepare for the Interview Process](https://careers.rutgers.edu/news/prepare-interview-process). In the preview 
        text under the link, the words <b>Big Interview</b> were bolded in a sentence "Also, use <b>Big Interview</b> Resume AI, 
        an online resource in <b>Rutgers</b> Handshake."</p>
    
      <p><i>(Author's note: There may be something advantagous in reviewing the entirety of this page, but for now, so as not 
        to delay myself, I will follow this lead and sign into <a href="https://joinhandshake.com/">Handshake</a> using my netID.</i></p>
    
      <p>Now on the landing page that you are redirected to when you log into handshake, I am going to click the first link below 
        the immediate notifications on the homepage, the link that is displayed as a Rutgers career logo, with the title, 
        "Rutgers University - New Brunswick (Flagship Campus) Career Center -->" to its right and the words, 
        "View your school's resources" below it, as Big Interview was described as a resource in Handshake.</p>
    
      <p>This brings me to R(Careers), the Handshake page for Rutgers' Career Services. One of the first four links displayed is 
        "Resources." Hitting that, I am taken to a list of resources for use with a search bar up top. Typing in "Big Interview" 
        brings up "Big Interview--Interview and Resume Prep:" described as "allowing (the user) to rehearse questions online and 
        further develop strong interview skills." I click the "Access <a href="https://rutgers.biginterview.com/">Big Interview</a> here" link, 
        and it prompts me to "Register for Free" or "Learn More."</p>
