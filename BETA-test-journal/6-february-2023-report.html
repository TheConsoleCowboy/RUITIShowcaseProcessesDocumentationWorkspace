    <ul>
      <li>Might be helpful to make clear at the outset that Big Interview is a service through Rutgers' 
      Career Services page on <a href="https://joinhandshake.com/">Handshake</a>. That said, I also understand the merit in encouraging
      students to practice information seeking.</li>
      <li>A "READ ME: Big Interview 101" type of page? I know I'm personally, as a student, 
      curious what the heck it is but also not 100% invested in delving into the "Learn More" section</li>
