        <p>Htting register, it just asked for my NetID.</p>
        
        <p><i>(Authors note: Still have to check and see if it requests password if you log
            in without already being logged in)</i></p>

        <p>Alright, so immediately after that, it brought me to a page with a number of modules, one option for the "Fast Track," 
            one for the "Mastery Track."</p>
