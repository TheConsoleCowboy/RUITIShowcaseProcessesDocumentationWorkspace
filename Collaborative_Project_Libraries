                media links on the left side of a divider and a Teacher-Student login portal on the right of the divider. The Teacher-Student login section has two options: 
                Log in with school account and Enter class code. The option that reads Log in with school account is circled in red.">
      <p>After inputting your NetID and password, you will be redirected to the <a href="https://express.adobe.com/sp/" target="_blank">Adobe Express homepage</a>. <b>From here, it is highly recommended that you

                branding logo at the top left corner, a search bar off-center right, and membership, notification, and to-profile information on the right hand side. The center of the screen invites the user to 
                create a new project and displays a number of templates for them to choose from. On the bottom of the image is the "Try a quick action" menu which includes 
                tabs such as Popular, Image, Video, QR Code, and PDF. On the left hand side of the page is a vertical menu with various icons for the user, including, in descending order
                Home, Projects, Brands, Libraries, and Learn. The Learn icon is circled in red by the author of this article and there is a red arrow pointing to it also placed by the writer.">
      <img src="https://github.com/TheConsoleCowboy/RUITIShowcaseProcessesDocumentationWorkspace/blob/main/Images/Adobe_Express_Homepage_Screen_Direct_to_Libraries.png" alt="The learn menu on Adobe Express including the text, Create stand-out content that inspires your audience with these articles, resources and tutorials. Below this text is a header that reads, Explore tutorials. Below that is a horizontal
                list of video with tutorial names under them including Group objects, remove background, add a brand to any template, and undo and redo. Above undo and redo is linked text that reads, View all. This linked text is circled in red by the 
                writer of this article and a red arrow is pointing to it, also placed by the writer.">
      <img src="https://github.com/TheConsoleCowboy/RUITIShowcaseProcessesDocumentationWorkspace/blob/main/Images/Adobe_Express_Tutorials_Screen.png" alt="The Tutorials page of Adobe Express including Tutorials in a large font at the page's top center and the
                subtitle, Learn the basics, or refine your skills. Below this, there is a centered header that reads, Getting Started, and a subtitle below it that reads, New to Adobe Express? Watch these quick videos to learn the basics.">
      <p>Here, you will find a number of tutorial videos that break down various Adobe Express features, <b>including a very brief look at how to collaborate using Adobe Express</b>:</p>

                like gradiant purple boxes with symbols and the name of the tutorial within them. These icons link to specific YouTube video tutorials. One of them reads, Invite project collaborators, and it has a symbol representing the bust of a person inside a circle
                with a plus symbol over their left breast. The tutorial title attached to it reads, Invite project collaborators. This symbol and title are circled in red by the 
                writer of this article and a red arrow is pointing to them, also placed by the writer.">
