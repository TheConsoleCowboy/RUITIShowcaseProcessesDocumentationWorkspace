    <h1>Creating a Collaborative Library</h1>
    <p>On the <a href="https://express.adobe.com/sp/" target="_blank">Adobe Express homepage</a>, select the <b><a href="https://express.adobe.com/sp/libraries/owned" target="_blank">library</a> icon</b>:</p>

         alt="The same image as the one titled The Adobe Express hompage. This image can first be seen at https://theconsolecowboy.github.io/RUITIShowcaseProcessesDocumentationWorkspace/first_step.html. On the left hand side of the page, there is a column of icons that link to other pages on the site, including 
              (in descending order) Home, Projeects, Brands, Libraries Learn. The Libraries icon, which has the word Libraries under a symbol of a box with 
              a ribbon at its top, off-center right, is circled in red by the author of this article and there is a red arrow (also by the author of this article)
              pointing at it to indicate the reader should click it." height="559" width="1071">
    <p>This will redirect you to the Libraries page. Once here, select <b>"Create a Library."</b> This will take you to a screen where you will be prompted to <b>name your 
        new library</b> before creating it.</p>

         alt="Title: The Adobe Express Libraries page. There are two square icons on the main screen, going left to right. The one of the left has an oval button with a blue
              outline and blue text that reads, Create Library. The Create Library button is circled in red by the writer of the article 
              to indicate that the reader is meant to click it." height="559" width="1071">

    <img src="https://theconsolecowboy.github.io/RUITIShowcaseProcessesDocumentationWorkspace/Images/Adobe_Express_Create_Library_Screen.png" 
         alt="Title: The Create Library pop-up. A pop-up over the Adobe Express Libraries screen that uses grey to dim down the screen behind it. This pop up screen reads at its
              top left, Create new Library. Below that is a space where the user can type and a prompt that reads, Library Name on a blue line. Below
              this is an auto-fill option the author of this article left to show a relevant example that reads, Rutgers_ITI. Finally, on the bottom right side of the corner,
              there are two buttons; the one on the left reads, Cancel, and the one on the right, which is dim grey and unusable because nothing has been filled in yet, reads, Create Library." height="559" width="1071">

         alt="The same image as the one titled, The Create Library pop-up. Only this time the space where the user can type is filled in with the autofill in the previous picture which reads, Rutgers ITI. Also, the two buttons
              at the bottom are both now usable, indicated by the fact that the Create Library button is now purple-ish blue with white text. The author has circled the Create Library
              button in red, indicating that the reader is meant to click it." height="559" width="1071">
    <p>You will then be redirected to your new library <b>where you can create assets and templates for use on any and all projects related to Rutgers ITI</b>.</p>
    <p><i><u>(Author's note: Will break down the difference between templates and assets in future articles and link those here)</u></i></p>

         alt="Title: A Custom Library. A custom library in Adobe Express called Rutgers_ITI. At the top left corner is the title of the
              library, Rutgers_ITI, in larger letters, and a back arrow to its left that the user could use to 
              return to the previous page, the Libraries page. Below this title are two smaller menu icons, one reads Template, the other reads Assets.
              Below these, there are two square icons. The one on the right displays the image of a sample template that the writer of this article created. The template is called ITI_Showcase_Promo_Template,
              and if the user clicked on it, they would be directed to that template. The icon on the left has at its center a symbol of a document with a fold in the top left corner, as if someone
              were using that corner to turn a page, and the outline of a bolt of lightning in its bottomr right corner. Below this symbol is an oval button with a blue outline and blue text that reads,
              Add template. Finally, in the top right corner of the page, there is a share icon broken into a symbol on the left and text to the right of it. The symbol is meant to represent a person's
              bust with a circled plus sign over the left breast. It is a white symbol against a blue, circular shape. Next to it, also written in blue, is the word, Share." height="559" width="1071">
    <p>From here, click on the <b>"Share"</b> icon. This will open up an "Invite to..." screen:</p>

         alt="This image is the same as the one titled, A Custom Library. Only now there is a red line, created by the writer of this article, drawn around the Share icon and 
              a red arrow, also drawn on by the author, pointing to it to direct the reader to click on it." height="559" width="1071">

    <img src="https://theconsolecowboy.github.io/RUITIShowcaseProcessesDocumentationWorkspace/Images/Adobe_Express_Invite_to_Library_Screen.png" 
         alt="Title: The Invite to Rutgers_ITI pop-up menu. The Rutgers_ITI library page described above is now partially covered and dimmed down with grey by a pop-up. The pop-up, at its top left corner,
              reads, Invite to Rutgers_ITI. Below that is a line where the user can enter the names or emails on the people they want to invite. The line is titled, Add People, in small lettering along 
              its top left side. Below it is another line where the user can write in words titled with small letters on its top left side. That title reads, Message (optional). Below these two lines
              at the bottom right corner of the pop-up box, are two buttons, one on the left which is a drop down menu, and one on the right which is a command. The drop down menu is closed currently but reads 
              one of the two options, Can edit. The button on the left is white text against a blue oval shape. The text reads, Invite. Finally, another popu-up box, much shorter but the same width
              as the one described sits, directly below the bottom of the described pop-up. In its top left corner, it reads, Get link. Below that it reads, Only people with read or edit access can open
              with this link; people who don't have edit rights can request access. This is the end of what the text reads. Finally, on the right hand side of its boundaries, halfway down the page, in blue text, there is text. The text reads: Copy link." height="559" width="1071">
    <p>Here you can</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Invite team members</b> by name or by email <i>(Note: It is important to make sure you have the correct user name and email address)</i>:</li>

              to click on it." height="559" width="1071">

         alt="The same as the image titled The Invite to Rutgers_ITI pop-up menu, but now there is a change. The second line for the user to type on, the Message (optional) line is gone and in its place is an embedded 
              list. The list is titled at its top left with the words Members (2) and on at its top right corner is the Remove All command button. The list is bordered on the top and bottom with blue lines.
              The list itself possesses two emails, listed vertically. The top one has next to it the word Owner. The second one has next to it a drop-down menu indicated by the words Can edit and a downward facing
              arrow to their right. This drop down menu is boxed with a red line by the author of this article to direct the reader to click on it.
              The rest of the Invite to Rutgers_ITI pop-up is the same." height="559" width="1071">

         alt="The same as the image titled Invite to Rutgers_ITI pop-up menu. Only now, there is a red line boxing in the Copy link button. This was drawn in by the writer of this article
              to direct the user to click on that button." height="559" width="1071">
