        <h1>1 March 2023</h1>
        <p>Today, I am translating the date lists from 
            <a href="https://theconsolecowboy.github.io/RUITIShowcaseProcessesDocumentationWorkspace/work-journal/28-february-2023" target="_blank">28 February 2023</a>
        into a workable calendar on Google Calendars that can be better shared/visualized <i>(Who likes lists, right?)</i>
        </p>
        <p>Some side thoughts:
            <ul>
                <li>I really love interfaces that are intuitive and all you have to do to
                    update is click on the section you want to update... Google Calendars does not do
                    that. &#128529;
                </li>
                <li>Ended up adding an entry that I either missed yesterday or that they have added since, that being the <a href="https://admissions.newark.rutgers.edu/event/taft-college-fair" target="_blank">Rutgers on the Road Taft College Fair event.</a> 
                </li>
                <li>Also did some work to clean up the readablility of the <a href="https://theconsolecowboy.github.io/RUITIShowcaseProcessesDocumentationWorkspace/work-journal/" target="_blank">28 February 2023 entry</a></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
