        <h1>28 February 2023</h1>
        <p>Beginning work at 8:30 a.m. and planning to work for the next hour and
            a half or so on collecting infromation on student-facing events going on 
            at Rutgers that may conflict with the ITI Showcase's intended dates.
        </p>
        <h2>Searching Event Sites</h2>
        <p>Alright, so to begin this search, I am looking at the following links:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://scheduling.rutgers.edu/scheduling/academic-calendar" target="_blank">Rutgers New Brunswick's academic calendar</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.rutgers.edu/events" target="_blank">Rutgers' general events page</a></li>

            <li><a href="https://comminfo.rutgers.edu/event-listing">Rutgers SC&I events calendar</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://app.joinhandshake.com/stu/events?collection=ALL&eventFormat=HYBRID&sort=RELEVANCE&date=ALL">Rutgers Handshake event calendar</a></li>

        </ul>
        <p>Let's see what events are scheduled for the intended dates of the showcase, those dates being
            <b>20 April 2023</b> and <b>21 April 2023</b>. Let's build a list for each date:
        </p>
        <ul>20 April 2023
            <li><a href="https://rutgers.campuslabs.com/engage/event/8724462" target="_blank">Rutgers Commuter Student Association - Spring Carnival - 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.</a></li>
        </ul>

        </ul>
        <p>Above are the conflicts collected from the list of sites.</p>
        <h2>Using Google Search Operators</h2>
        <p>Alright, my next plan, to make sure all bases were covered, was to run a search
            for the relevant dates using Google's search operators. The specific search I ran was
            <b>["Rutgers" AND ("April 20" OR "April 21") AND "2023"]</b>. Here are the reports on the 
            returned results:
